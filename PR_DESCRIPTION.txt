Title: feat: Add Staff Login + Auth Flow and UI Primitives

Summary:
This change introduces a baseline staff authentication flow and a set of UI primitives needed for operator/cashier/admin workflows. It adds a dedicated staff login page with role selection, an `AuthProvider` for session management, a `RoleGuard` route protection component, and basic UI components (`Button`, `Input`). The app layout now wraps pages with `AuthProvider` so sessions persist across navigation.

What changed (high level):
- Added Staff Login UI at `app/staff/login/page.jsx` (role selector, staff ID, login flow)
- Implemented `AuthProvider` for login/logout, session persistence (`localStorage`), and navigation
- Added `RoleGuard` to protect role-specific pages
- Introduced reusable UI primitives: `components/ui/button.jsx` and `components/ui/input.jsx` (uses `cn` util and `class-variance-authority`)
- Small utility: `lib/utils.js` adds `cn()` helper
- Wrapped root layout with `AuthProvider` in `app/layout.jsx`
- Updated project config/dependencies and assets (Tailwind / Next / public icons)

- app/layout.jsx
- package.json (new/updated deps)

Motivation:
Provide a simple, auditable staff login baseline so teams can build role-specific workflows (Admin, Cashier, Operator). The login is intentionally lightweight (mock device/shift info) and designed to be replaced when backend auth is added.

How to test locally (manual):
1. Install deps: `npm install` (if necessary).
2. Run dev server: `npm run dev`.
3. Navigate to `/staff/login`.
4. Enter a STAFF ID and select a role (Admin / Cashier / Operator).
5. Click "ENTER DASHBOARD" and verify:
   - An alert shows successful login and the selected role.
   - `localStorage` contains `seefood_session` with role and username.
   - Cashier users navigate to `/staff/cashier`, others navigate to `/staff/dashboard`.
6. Try accessing a protected route when not logged in; the `RoleGuard` should redirect to `/staff/login`.

Notes & limitations:
- Dashboard modules are currently removed for this baseline; the login page shows an alert noting the dashboard is not included.
- Auth is client-side mock only (no backend integration). Audit logs are console-based for now.
- Consider adding proper tests and end-to-end checks before enabling production rollout.

Checklist:
- [ ] Manual QA: login/logout and role redirects
- [ ] Linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] Add unit/E2E tests for `AuthProvider` and `RoleGuard`
- [ ] Add backend auth integration (future)
